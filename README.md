# spacey

Reflection

Requirements met:
- Each section is wrapped in correct semantic tags & includes <header>, <nav>, <footer>
- Implemented CSS absolute position to overlay text on an image(background)
- Utilised CSS flexbox to create a responsive webpage
- all images are implemented using local src file paths

Stretch requirements met:
- Created a back to top button
- Implemented smooth scrolling
- Implemented hover effects on buttons & nav items
- Created a basic footer with social media icons which link to spacex social pages

Other:
- I could have made the website more responsive; probably would have started with a mobile display size & built up from there if i was to start again.
- This was my first attempt at making a nav bar from scratch, previously having used only bootstrap, so this was the most difficult task.
- css-tricks was useful & I discovered the "white-space" property which came in handy in fixing an error of my navbar wrapping as the display shrank. However this then caused a whitespace issue on smaller displays so I used a media query to hide the culprit (navbar) on smaller displays.
- The background image choice was not the best in some sections due to the white text sometimes getting lost, again on smaller displays, but I wanted to remain close to the source doc (spacex.com), so persisted with the white text.
